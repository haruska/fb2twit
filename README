== fb2twit

This application was written to serve two purposes.

1. The default Twitter app on Facebook only syncs TO facebook.
However, the opposite makes more sense for each community. Facebook
status should only be updated 1-2 times a day where people following
twitter expect many more updates.

2. I wanted to play with facebookr.


== Open Source

All the code is released under MIT license. I've open sourced it to help
others write quick facebook apps using rails.

Feel free to make changes / additions and I'll post it to the server.
